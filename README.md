Tunneling software is a tool that allows you to easily and securely connect local servers to external networks, providing access to local applications through public URLs.

## Project Focus

- Create temporary or permanent tunnels: Users can quickly set up connections, allowing other users or services to interact with their local applications without the need for a network configuration diagram.

- HTTP and TCP protocol support: The software supports various communication protocols, allowing you to work with different types of applications, from simple websites to more complex servers.

- Change access settings: Users can control access to their local resources using authentication and IP filters, ensuring the security of their data.

- Monitor activity and performance: The tool provides information about requests, routes and tunnel performance, making it easier to debug and improve quality of service.

- Share resources quickly: The tool allows developers and teams to instantly share their local projects with colleagues, clients or investors, significantly speeding up the workflow.

> This software is ideal for developers, testers and IT professionals who need to provide access to local resources in the face of limited network connectivity or need to quickly demonstrate how applications work.
